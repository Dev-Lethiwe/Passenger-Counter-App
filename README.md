# Passenger-Counter-App
Part of the Scrimba JavaScript course with my own additions

[Website link](https://passengercounter-devlethiwe.netlify.app/)

Scrimba course tasks:
  1. Track how many passengers get in
  2. Save the number of passengers
  3. Reset the counter
  4. Show previous entries after each SAVE

My additions:
  1. Decrease the counter in case some passengers get off
  2. Have the total capacity known
  3. Track how many spaces are available
  4. Have a "maximum capacity reached" popup if user wants to add more passengers than the available capacity
