## Functionality

### Scrimba course tasks:

  4. Show previous entries after each SAVE

### My additions:
  1. Decrease the counter in case some passengers get off
  2. Have the total capacity known
  3. Track how many spaces are available
  4. Have a "maximum capacity reached" popup if user wants to add more passengers than the available capacity
